# Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of sample code I've crafted to serve various purposes .

- Agent-Based Model - (Python, Pandas, SciPy): Multi-period agent-based model and simulation of agents that buy, sell, and stake tokens as sell as earn them through a task verification process.
- Corona Analysis - (Matlab): Collection of Machine Learning methods to analyze temperature maps of the solar corona. I mainly used the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method separates time and space information, thus allowing one to determine the dominant spaceâ€“time scales.
- PyTorch Examples: Compilation of Machine Learning methods (mainly supervised learning) using PyTorch.
- Test 1 toolkit - (Javascript, HTML, CSS): Contiaing the backend and frontend of a tokenomics simulation tool.
- VAPEMOMO - (Python, Pandas): Stands for "VApor PrEssures of Magma Ocean's Metal Oxides". This code computes the atmospheric pressure of metal-oxides at a given temperature by assuming congruent evaporation vapor pressures from Lamoreaux and Hildenbrand (1984); Lamoreaux et al. (1987). The results of this code are presented in Jaeggi et al. (2021).
